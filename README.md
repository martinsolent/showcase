*Instagram, a fairly new platform for capturing and sharing photos and videos, has quickly grown since its launch in 2010. While Instagram has always maintained that the app has been designed with a focus on mobile-only use, a desktop version was released in 2013 to make the app more accessible to its rapidly growing community. Although the desktop feed functions exactly as the mobile version, allowing users to follow profiles and like pictures, a key feature missing from the current desktop version is the ability to upload photos from a desktop. The reason behind the omission of this crucial feature is that Instagram is designed for capturing and sharing photos in the real world, in real time.*
